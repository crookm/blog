title: An Introduction Is In Order, This Is Me

  A post rescued from an old blog of mine from the Wayback Machine. I was 14 when I wrote this, so it's a bit cringy.
  
  This was my first ever blog post as 'me'.

I’m not too good with introductions, but I’ll give it my best.

I recently made this blog to share my knowledge with programming, and to bitch about my personal life.

I feel I should warn you, I do not plan on enabling comments on any posts. I simply do not want to reply to low quality questions, or deal with any spam.

I will try to post as much as I can, but no promises...

I am quite savvy with PHP, HTML, JavaScript, and I’m learning a bit of Java and Pearl. Though Java looks really difficult, I may put that off a while.

I am interested in games like Minecraft, Skyrim, and crazy Japanese games. My favourite game at the moment is LSD: Dream Emulator.

I have had experiences as a Moderator on a large Minecraft server called "CityCraft" (citycraft.co.uk). I decided to leave because of the rude-mannered children that occupy the server. The only decent people that I could talk to were the other staff members.

I’ll take this opportunity to say a bit about what I may be posting here. I plan to release code snippets, free downloads, and tutorials.
