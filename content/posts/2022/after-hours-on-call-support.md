The company I work for is the antithesis of Google; where Google kills products [almost religiously](https://killedbygoogle.com), my workplace has deprecated almost nothing in thirty years of existence, but still loves to ship new products and systems.

There are valid reasons for this operating strategy; our customers appreciate the long-term support and reliability, but couple this with an unprecedented shortage of software engineers in the industry, and you have a recipe for trouble.

I'm on the after hours on-call roster, which is voluntary. There are not many others on this list, and the number of services we monitor is high - as well as a catch-all Jira service desk that is routed to my team.

With so many things that could fail, the likelihood of receiving a callout is very high. There can be massive gaps of several months between callouts, interspersed with so-called "hell weeks", where there can be a callout almost every night.

Being called-out this often is a problem, but I always come-up empty when thinking of a solution. The business wants high-availability for all services, but we don't have the head-count to work on reliability of those services.
