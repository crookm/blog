My flatmates are game devs and graphic designers, so I regularly hear them talk about 3D modeling and animation. I've always been interested in learning how to do it myself as a creative outlet, but I never had the time or motivation to start. Now that I'm on holiday, I decided to give it a go.

I learn primarily by doing, so I started by watching and following along with YouTube tutorials - specifically [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xAumJRKV6A) by PIXXO 3D. It went by a bit quickly which made it hard to following along, but I managed to get the basics down and create a really simple humanoid figure.

The tutorial was helpful in learning how to use the tools in Blender, as well as how to model something from a primitive shape. I also learned about the modifiers and how to use them to make the modeling process easier - such as the mirror and subdivision surface modifiers.

I'm not a particularly creative person to begin with, so don't laugh at my first attempt! ðŸ˜‚ I found modeling the hands to be the most difficult part, and they still look weird proportionally.

It's been fun, so I intend to keep learning and practicing. I'm going to try and make a few more figures, and then try the rest of the pipeline - rigging, texturing, etc. I want to then put the skills to use as part of a game dev project, but I'm not sure what yet. I'll keep you posted!
