After spending an entire year of promising myself I wouldn't distro-hop into another Linux OS any more, I thought I would reward myself by installing another OS. Linux Mint this time.

Can't say its entirely my own fault though - I tried updating Ubuntu 20.04 to 21.10, but apparently I didn't have enough space in my boot partition to upgrade, and I couldn't resize my other partitions to make room. I would have had to re-install anyway.

May as well have made that something new and exciting!

I've used Mint before, and I was totally fine with it last time before switching to Debian (then Ubuntu). My problem is just that I want a bit of change every now-and-then, so I swap Cinnamon for GNOME.

I could probably just switch out my desktops instead of re-installing, which I may look at doing this time if I have the need. Though, this is what I said to myself last time, and look how that turned out.

Vagrant is definitely going to be something to look at, for the future.
